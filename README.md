How to install jupyter Notebook

http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

There are different ways to install jupyter and python 
Prerequisite: Python
1. Installing Jupyter using Anaconda and conda
2. Alternative for experienced Python users: Installing Jupyter with pip

But its best to use Anaconda for installation since ---

Installing Python from scratch is no joy. Many scienti c packages require a speci c version of Python or R computer language along with many dependencies. It's hard to keep packages from interacting with each other, and harder to keep them all updated. Anaconda makes getting and maintaining all these packages quick and easy.

What is Anaconda?

It is an open source, easy-to-install high performance Python and R distribution, with conda package and environment manager and collection of 1,000+ open source packages
with free community support.
