Here we will be using jupyter Notebook for initial programming and then finally move to IDE 

How to install jupyter Notebook

http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

There are different ways to install jupyter and python 
Prerequisite: Python
1. Installing Jupyter using Anaconda and conda
2. Alternative for experienced Python users: Installing Jupyter with pip

But its best to use Anaconda for installation since ---

Installing Python from scratch is no joy. Many scienti c packages require a specific version of Python or R computer language along with many dependencies. It's hard to keep packages from interacting with each other, and harder to keep them all updated. Anaconda makes getting and maintaining all these packages quick and easy.

What is Anaconda?

It is an open source, easy-to-install high performance Python and R distribution, with conda package and environment manager and collection of 1,000+ open source packages
with free community support.

Use the following installation steps:

Download Anaconda. We recommend downloading Anaconda’s latest Python 3 version (currently Python 3.5).

Install the version of Anaconda which you downloaded, following the instructions on the download page.

Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook. To run the notebook:

            jupyter notebook
  
As an existing Python user, you may wish to install Jupyter using Python’s package manager, pip, instead of Anaconda.

First, ensure that you have the latest pip; older versions may have trouble with some dependencies:

pip3 install --upgrade pip
Then install the Jupyter Notebook using:

pip3 install jupyter
(Use pip if using legacy Python 2.)

Congratulations. You have installed Jupyter Notebook. See http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running
for more details.
